So many people on the web say that benchmarking by just warming up 
and timing is not enough - well, I tried using Criterium for my 
Clojure code and came up with pretty much the same measurements
(I run 10 times to warm up 'solve' and take the best measurement
to account for HotSpotting). 

I did the same here for Java - using Apache JMH - and reached the
same conclusion. These frameworks may be necessary for micro-benchmarking;
but for timing a function that takes 100s of ms, I no longer think
they are necessary - not after the experiments I did,

Anyway, here's how to measure with JMH:

    $ cd benchmarks
    $ ./run.sh
